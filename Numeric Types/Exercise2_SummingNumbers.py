The challenge here is to write a mysum function that does the same thing as the
built-in sum function. However, instead of taking a single sequence as a parameter, it
should take a variable number of arguments. Thus, although you might invoke
sum([1,2,3]), youâ€™d instead invoke mysum(1,2,3) or mysum(10,20,30,40,50).
"""

def mysum(*numbers):    #splat operator: allow a function to receive any number of arguments.
    output = 0
    for number in numbers:
        output += number
    return output

print(mysum(10, 20, 30, 40, 50))
